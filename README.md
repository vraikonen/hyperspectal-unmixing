# Unmixing hyperspectral images 

These two notebooks were homework for a course *Active and Multitemporal Remote Sensing* with prof. Lucas Drumetz. 

I do not have permission to share the data. 

One notebook applies PCA in order to reduce number of bands, and the other uses SPA algorithm to exctract endmembers which can be later applied in estimatation of the endmember abundance within the pixels spectra or classification tasks.

Notebooks have comments that explain the steps and the content.
